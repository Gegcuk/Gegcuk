# Hi there 👋, I'm Aleksei (@Gegcuk)

I'm a **Junior Java Developer** with a solid background in **Product Management**. As I near the end of **Phase 2** in my [learning journey](https://github.com/Gegcuk/learining_path), I've built a strong foundation in core Java, build tools, and database fundamentals. My hands-on projects—from developing secure APIs to ensuring transactional consistency—demonstrate my ability to turn complex requirements into practical solutions.

## 📚 Learning Path
I'm following a structured learning path that outlines my progress and planned milestones—from core Java foundations to advanced topics. Check out the details on my [Learning Path](https://github.com/Gegcuk/learining_path) repository.

## 📝 Learning Tactics
I use self-made tactics to enhance my learning based on recent researches. For every chapter I read, I create detailed tests that include:
- Open questions  
- Test questions  
- Multiple choice questions  
- Fill-the-gap exercises  
- Architecture and practice questions  

This approach reinforces my understanding and ensures I can apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Java (core & advanced), SQL, Python, C
